            "long_description": "The mansion's lobby, a cavernous chamber, oozed with an unsettling aura. Antique furniture, swathed in tattered drapes, stood frozen in time, their ornate carvings and faded upholstery whispering tales of opulence long past. The wallpaper, once regal, now hung in tatters, bearing the weight of forgotten memories. Candles, their flames flickering with trepidation, lined the mantle, casting grotesque shadows that danced on the frayed edges of a worn carpet. The air was thick with an uncanny stillness, laden with secrets waiting to be unearthed. It was a chilling prologue to the haunted mysteries that lay hidden within the mansion's depths."
